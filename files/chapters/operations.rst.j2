Operations Manual
=================

This chapter describes how to operate the PKI on a daily basis by describing common maintenance tasks.

These maintenance tasks should be carried out by the system owner in accordance with the maintenance schedule in Appendix C.

.. note:: Failure to carry out any maintenance task within the timeframe stipulated in the maintenance schedule, can cause degradation of the system or a system outage. It is the responsibiliy of the system owner to carry out the maintenance tasks, and to make a note of any deviations to the maintenance schedule.

{% if servers.root_ca.policy.key_storage_provider == 'Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider' or servers.issuing_ca.policy.key_storage_provider == 'Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider' %}
Limited protection of private keys
----------------------------------

The installation was done with limited protection of the private keys.

As no *hardware security module (HSM)* is being used, the private key of the *certificate authority (CA)* is stored on disk and may be decrypted and/or copied by any personnel with logical access to the CA.

As a consequence, it is important to restrict access to CA machines using logical and physical acccess control and be vigilant about any connection attempts.

- The root CA machine ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` should be turned off when not in use.
- Access should only be given to vetted personnel according to the CP/CPS.
- Access control lists and CA logs should be reviewed according to the maintenance schedule.
- Any keys which are suspected or confirmed to be compromised should be revoked.

Inspect the status of the PKI
-----------------------------

To determine the status of the PKI, you can use *Enterprise PKI Viewer*.

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Click on the start button, type ``pkiview.msc`` and press **Enter**.

#. Expand the tree on the left and click on your issuing CA.

#. Ensure that all entries are marked with *OK* in the *Status* column.

.. figure:: ../graphics/pkiview.png

      An example of what Enterprise PKI Viewer looks like for a fully-functional AD CS installation.

Back up the root CA
-------------------

Create a backup to disk using ``CertUtil``. The backup contains all issued certificates, the CA log, and the private key of the CA as a P12-file.

#. Turn on ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` and log in using RDP.

#. Run the backup command and type in the password used to protect the private key::

    CertUtil -backup C:\Backup

#. Backup keys in the registry::

    reg export HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CertSvc\Configuration C:\Backup\backup.reg

#. Transfer the backup directory ``C:\Backup`` to a secure location.

#. Turn off ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}``.

Restore a backup of the root CA
-------------------------------

#. Turn on ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` and log in using RDP.

#. Reset the server using SysPrep::

    %WINDIR%\system32\sysprep\sysprep.exe /generalize /reboot /oobe

When configuring Windows, configure the name of the server to be ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` as specified in the backup file.

#. Transfer the latest backup directory ``C:\Backup`` to the root CA server.

#. Install the AD CS Windows feature::

    Install-WindowsFeature Adcs-Cert-Authority -IncludeManagementTools

#. Restore the CA certificate and private key::

    $BackupPassword = Read-Host -AsSecureString
    Install-AdcsCertificationAuthority -CAType StandaloneRootCa -CertFile 'C:\Backup\R1.p12' -CertFilePassword $BackupPassword -DatabaseDirectory $(Join-Path $env:SystemRoot "System32\CertLog") -Force

#. Restore the CA database using CertUtil::

    Remove-Item C:\Windows\System32\CertLog\* -Force
    CertUtil -restoreDB C:\Backup

#. Import the registry keys::

    reg import C:\Backup\backup.reg

#. Restart AD CS::

    net stop certsvc
    net start certsvc

#. Turn off ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}``.

.. _issue root ca crl:

Issue a new root CA CRL
-----------------------

#. Turn on ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` and log in using RDP.

#. Issue a CRL from the root CA::

    CertUtil -crl

{% for server in servers.repositories %}
#. Transfer the file ``C:\R1.crt`` to ``C:\inetpub\pki`` on {{ server.name }}.
{% endfor %}

#. Turn off ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}``.

.. _renew new keys:

Replace an issuing CA and create a new keypair
----------------------------------------------

.. _renew reuse keys:

TODO: Write instructions for how to renew using a new keypair

Renew an issuing CA and reuse the existing keypair
--------------------------------------------------

Create a CSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Click on the Start button, type ``apps: certsrv`` and press **Enter**.

#. Right-click on ``ICA1`` in the tree on the left and click on **All Tasks → Renew CA Certificate...**.

#. Windows will ask if you want to stop AD CS. Click **Yes** to stop AD CS and continue with the renewal.

#. You will now have the option to generate a new keypair. Pick **No** to keep the existing keypair and click on **OK**.

#. Click on **Cancel** to save the CSR to disk and to start AD CS again.

#. Transfer the file ``C:\ICA1.req`` to ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}``.

Sign the CA certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Submit the CSR for the issuing CA and save the request ID::

    $request = CertReq -submit -config - C:\ICA1.csr | Out-String | Select-String 'RequestId: (\d+)'
    $requestId = $request.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value.Trim()

#. Accept the request and retrieve a copy of the new issuing CA certificate::

    CertUtil -resubmit $requestId
    CertReq -retrieve -config - $requestId C:\ICA1.crt

#. Transfer the file ``C:\ICA1.crt`` to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}``.

Install the CA certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Install the CA certificate::

    CertUtil -installcert "C:\ICA1.crt"

#. Restart AD CS::

    net stop certsvc
    net start certsvc

#. Create a CRL and publish it to the repository::

    CertUtil -crl
    Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CopyCRL"

{% for repository in servers.repositories %}
#. Transfer the file ``C:\ICA1.crt`` to ``C:\inetpub\pki`` on {{ repository.name }}. Replace the existing file.
{% endfor %}

Revoke an issuing CA
--------------------

You should only revoke an issuing CA certificate if you suspect that the private key may have been compromised, as revoking a CA will cause all certificates issued from it to be invalidated.

#. If you are revoking the issuing CA currently being in use, you should :ref:`renew the issuing CA certificate <renew new keys>` first.

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. List the certificates issued by the root CA using CertUtil. Make a note of the serial number for the certificate you want to revoke::

    CertUtil -out "Issued Common Name","Certificate Expiration date","Serial Number" -view Log csv

#. Revoke the certificate, replace ``serial number`` with the serial number of the certificate as reported by CertUtil::

    CertUtil -revoke "serial number"

#. Follow :ref:`the instructions to issue a new CRL from the root CA <issue root ca crl>`.

Revoke the certificate for a domain computer
--------------------------------------------

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Make a note of the serial number of the certificate you want to revoke.

    .. note:: Lookup the serial number

        If you have a copy of the certificate saved as ``C:\Certificate.crt`` you can get the serial number like this:

        .. code-block:: powershell

            CertUtil -dump 'C:\Certificate.crt' | Select-String 'Serial Number'

        If you do not have a copy of the certificate, you can list all certificates issued to a particular computer in the domain using CertUtil. Replace ``computerName`` with the name of the computer:

        .. code-block:: powershell

            CertUtil -out "Certificate Expiration date","Serial Number" -restrict "RequesterName = {{ customer.domain.split('.')[0].upper() }}\computerName$" -view Log csv

#. Revoke the certificate using CertUtil. Replace ``serial number`` with the serial number of the certificate::

    CertUtil -revoke "serial number"

#. Optionally create a new CRL and push it out to the repository::

    CertUtil -crl
    Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CopyCRL"

Revoke the certificate for a domain user
----------------------------------------

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.issuing_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. Make a note of the serial number of the certificate you want to revoke.

    .. note:: Lookup the serial number

        If you have a copy of the certificate saved as ``C:\Certificate.crt`` you can get the serial number like this:

        .. code-block:: powershell

            CertUtil -dump 'C:\Certificate.crt' | Select-String 'Serial Number'

        If you do not have a copy of the certificate, you can list all certificates issued to a particular user in the domain using CertUtil. Replace ``userName`` with the name of the user:

        .. code-block:: powershell

            CertUtil -out "Certificate Expiration date","Serial Number" -restrict "RequesterName = {{ customer.domain.split('.')[0].upper() }}\userName" -view Log csv

#. Revoke the certificate using CertUtil. Replace ``serial number`` with the serial number of the certificate::

    CertUtil -revoke "serial number"

#. Optionally create a new CRL and push it out to the repository::

    CertUtil -crl
    Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CopyCRL"

Reenroll all certificate holders
--------------------------------

Reenrollment of a certificate occurrs when the certificate is about to expire, or when the schema version of the certificate template used to issue the certificate has been updated.

{% endif %}

Renew a root CA certificate
---------------------------

In a Microsoft environment, you can renew the root CA certificate with a new validity date if the root CA is about to expire, or if the private key of the root CA has been compromised.

Once you have renewed the root CA certificate, you need to publish it to Active Directory. Windows devices connected to the domain will obtain the new root CA certificate automatically when they restart or after the Group Policy Refresh Interval (8 hours by default).

Clients can use the propritary Microsoft certificate extension ``1.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.2`` to link the new root CA certificate to the old CA certificate.

In a non-Microsoft environment it is recommended to create a new root CA and reissue any certificates from this root. You may have to manually distribute the new root CA to the truststore of any machines which require it.

#. Log in to ``{{ servers.root_ca.name }}`` using RDP.

#. If you want to extend the lifetime of your root CA, create or edit the file ``%systemroot%\CAPolicy.inf`` and make sure the following sections are present::

    [Version]
    Signature = "$Windows NT$"

    [CertSrv_Server]
    RenewalValidityPeriodUnits = 30
    RenewalValidityPeriod = Years

.. note:: Adjust ``RenewalValidityPeriodUnits`` to fit your needs. The ``NotBefore`` date in the new root CA certificate is set to the local clock and the ``NotAfter`` date is set to the local clock + the number of years specified in ``RenewalValidityPeriodUnits``.

.. note:: You cannot decrease the validity time of the root CA.

#. Check the local time against a reliable watch, and adjust it if necessary.

#. Click on the Start button, type ``mmc.exe`` and press **Enter**.

#. Press **Ctrl + M**, double-click on the **Certificate Authority** snap-in and click on **Finish**.

#. Click on **OK** to add the snap-in.

#. Expand **Certification Authority (Local)** the left pane, right-click on **R1** and choose **All Tasks → Renew CA Certificate...**.

#. Click **Yes** to stop AD CS.

#. In the *Renew CA Certificate* dialog box, choose if you want to create a new keypair when renewing the root CA certificate, and click on **OK**.

#. Issue a CRL from the root CA::

    CertUtil -crl

#. Export the new root CA certificate to a file::

    CertUtil "-ca.cert" "C:\R1.crt"

{% for server in servers.repositories %}
#. Transfer the files ``C:\R1.crt`` and ``C:\R1.crl`` to ``C:\inetpub\pki`` on {{ server.name }}.
{% endfor %}

#. Transfer the file `C:\R1.crt`` to {{ servers.issuing_ca.name }} and publish the root CA certificate to AD::

    CertUtil -dspublish -f C:\R1.crt
